# Extracting Triad Motif Significance Profiles from Complex Networks

__Institution__: AIT Budapest

__Instructor__: Dániel Ábel

__Project Description__: Write a program that can extract the triad motif significance profile of an input network. Compare the motif profile of the networks used in the practical session. Give a 5-8 minute presentation (beside the motif significance profiles) showing how the frequency of a given motif is changing when randomizing the network, and include snapshots of the networks before and after the randomization.
